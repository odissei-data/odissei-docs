# Introduction

The ODISSEI Portal is a project funded by the EU (grant number: ), to create and develop a metadata portal aimed at semantic linkages. The information contained within the pages that follow document the journey of creating such a portal, specifically from a technical perspective. This will pertain to the following subjects:

1. How to spin the portal locally and get data in it.
2. A detailed look at the various components and their purpose.
3. A short guide on getting this to a deployed instance.
4. A living document used for debugging needs and topics.
